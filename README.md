# Kana quiz

[Kana quiz](kana) challenges you to find the correct match between [Hiragana](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) and [Romaji](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romaji), [Katakana](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana) and Romaji, or Hiragana and Katakana characters.

Kana and Romaji characters are arranged in a grid that shows the relationships between characters: each column corresponds to a consonant, while each row represents a vocal sound (in the conventional Japanese order: a, i, u, e, o). [Dakuten and Handakuten](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakuten) characters such as が or ト゚ are currently unsupported.
