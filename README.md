# JQuiz

JQuiz is a collection of simple, web-based games for learning the Japanese language.

## Kana quiz

[Kana quiz](kana) challenges you to find the correct match between [Hiragana](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) and [Romaji](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romaji), [Katakana](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katakana) and Romaji, or Hiragana and Katakana characters.

Kana and Romaji characters are arranged in a grid that shows the relationships between characters: each column corresponds to a consonant, while each row represents a vocal sound (in the conventional Japanese order: a, i, u, e, o). [Dakuten and Handakuten](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakuten) characters such as が or ト゚ are currently unsupported.

# Developers / Help wanted

JQuiz is currently based on a very old code I wrote in my spare time. I still find the program useful today, but it is a bit outdated. Code is messy, CSS is too dry, many game parameters are hardcoded... and there's only a single game in the collection!

If you want to help to clean up, improve or expand JQuiz, feel free to fork this repository or to request to be added as a collaborator.

If you just use it and find a bug or you come up with an idea for a new feature, please file an issue.

Finally, if you just want to share your ideas about learning the Japanese language, feel free to contact me :) .
